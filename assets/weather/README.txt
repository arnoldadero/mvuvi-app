Weather Icons

This directory contains placeholder images for different weather conditions. In a production environment, you should replace these with high-quality images that clearly represent each weather condition.

Required weather condition icons:
- clear-day.png
- clear-night.png
- partly-cloudy-day.png
- partly-cloudy-night.png
- cloudy.png
- rain.png
- thunderstorm.png
- snow.png
- fog.png
- wind.png
- hail.png

For best results, use PNG images with transparency, sized at 256x256 pixels.
