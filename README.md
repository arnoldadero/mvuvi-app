# Mvuvi - Smart Fishing Platform for Kenyan Fishermen

## Overview

Mvuvi (meaning "Fisherman" in Swahili) is a mobile application built with Expo Go designed to empower Kenyan small-scale fishermen. The app provides real-time information about weather conditions, fish findings, local market prices, safety tools, sustainable fishing practices, and allows fishermen to record their catch data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Yarn or npm
- Expo CLI
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start the development server
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
   or
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```

### Development Commands

- Start the development server: `yarn start` or `npx expo start`
- Run on Android: `yarn android` or `npx expo start --android`
- Run on iOS: `yarn ios` or `npx expo start --ios`
- Run on web: `yarn web` or `npx expo start --web`
- Run TypeScript type checking: `yarn tsc` or `npx tsc`
- Run linting: `yarn lint` or `npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx`
- Fix linting issues: `yarn lint:fix` or `npx eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --fix`

### Web Development Notes

When running the app on web, some native-only features like maps will display fallback components. The app uses platform-specific code to handle these differences:

- `components/maps/MapView.tsx` provides a cross-platform map component that works on both native and web platforms
- Native-only modules are conditionally imported based on the platform

## Implementation Plan

A detailed implementation plan for the remaining features is available in the [docs/implementation-plan.md](docs/implementation-plan.md) file. This document outlines the step-by-step approach for each feature, including technical requirements, dependencies, and estimated timelines.
